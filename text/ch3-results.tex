\section{MBP-GCaMP}
% TODO: caution about phrasing!
Furthermore, we wanted to test whether the cells which were labelled by out MBP-GCaMP virus, but could not be identified as oligodendrocytes were neurons, astrocytes or microglia.
Hence, we developed two panels staining for NeuN (neurons), Olig2 (oligodendrocytes) and GFAP (astrocytes) or Iba1 (microglia), respectively, and tested those panels on mouse tissue. After imaging with a slide scanner microscope, we could confirm that the stains had worked.
However, there was some overlap in the excitation wavelength (TODO: is that right??) of GCaMP8s with one of our secondary antibodies, so that we could not distinguish GCaMP8s from NeuN signals.
Future work will need to repeat these stains in a MBP-GCaMP injected mouse brain with a different selection of secondary antibodies.
