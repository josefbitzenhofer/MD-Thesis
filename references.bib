   abstract = {Spatial memories that can last a lifetime are thought to be encoded during ‘online’ periods of exploration and subsequently consolidated into stable cognitive maps through their ‘offline’ reactivation. However, the mechanisms and computational principles by which offline reactivation stabilize long-lasting spatial representations remain poorly understood. Here, we employed simultaneous fast calcium imaging and electrophysiology to track hippocampal place cells over 2 weeks of online spatial reward learning behavior and offline resting. We describe that recruitment to persistent network-level offline reactivation of spatial experiences in mice predicts the future representational stability of place cells days in advance of their online reinstatement. Moreover, while representations of reward-adjacent locations are generally more stable across days, offline-reactivation-related stability is, conversely, most prominent for reward-distal locations. Thus, while occurring on the tens of milliseconds timescale, offline reactivation is uniquely associated with the stability of multiday representations that counterbalance the overall reward-adjacency bias, thereby predicting the stabilization of cognitive maps that comprehensively reflect entire underlying spatial contexts. These findings suggest that post-learning offline-related memory consolidation plays a complimentary and computationally distinct role in learning compared to online encoding.},

   abstract = {Neuroscience can only be reproducible when its key methods are quantitative and interpretable. Calcium imaging is such a key method which, however, records neuronal activity only indirectly and is therefore difficult to interpret. These difficulties arise primarily from the kinetics, nonlinearity, and sensitivity of the calcium indicator, but also depend on the methods for calcium signal analysis. Here, we evaluate the ability of the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8 to reveal neuronal spiking, and we investigate how existing spike inference methods (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) should be adapted for optimal performance. We demonstrate, both for principal cells and interneurons, that algorithms require fine-tuning to obtain optimal results with GCaMP8 data. Specifically, supervised algorithms adapted for GCaMP8 result in more linear and therefore more accurate recovery of complex spiking events. In addition, our analysis of cortical ground truth recordings shows that GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f or GCaMP8f - are able to reliably detect isolated action potentials for realistic noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that, due to their fast rise times, GCaMP8 indicators support shorter closed-loop latencies for real-time detection of neuronal activity. Together, our study provides demonstrations, tools, and guidelines to optimally process and quantitatively interpret calcium signals obtained with GCaMP8.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here, we longitudinally recorded the activity of neuronal populations in the mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC) during the performance of a context-choice association task.

We find that RSC representations of context and trial outcome display higher stability than motor choice, both at the single cell and population levels.

   abstract = {Summary
Spatial navigation relies on visual landmarks as well as on self-motion information. In familiar environments, both place and grid cells maintain their firing fields in darkness, suggesting that they continuously receive information about locomotion speed required for path integration. Consistently, “speed cells” have been previously identified in the hippocampal formation and characterized in detail in the medial entorhinal cortex. Here we investigated speed-correlated firing in the hippocampus. We show that CA1 has speed cells that are stable across contexts, position in space, and time. Moreover, their speed-correlated firing occurs within theta cycles, independently of theta frequency. Interestingly, a physiological classification of cell types reveals that all CA1 speed cells are inhibitory. In fact, while speed modulates pyramidal cell activity, only the firing rate of interneurons can accurately predict locomotion speed on a sub-second timescale. These findings shed light on network models of navigation.},

   abstract = {Impairment of episodic memory, a class of memory for spatiotemporal context of an event, is an early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease. Both spatial and temporal information are encoded and represented in the hippocampal neurons, but how these representations are impaired under amyloid β (Aβ) pathology remains elusive. We performed chronic imaging of the hippocampus in awake male amyloid precursor protein (App) knock-in mice behaving in a virtual reality environment to simultaneously monitor spatiotemporal representations and the progression of Aβ depositions. We found that temporal representation is preserved, whereas spatial representation is significantly impaired in the App knock-in mice. This is because of the overall reduction of active place cells, but not time cells, and compensatory hyperactivation of remaining place cells near Aβ aggregates. These results indicate the differential impact of Aβ aggregates on two major modalities of episodic memory, suggesting different mechanisms for forming and maintaining these two representations in the hippocampus.},

   abstract = {The kinetics of amyloid plaque formation and growth as one of the characteristic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are fundamental issues in AD research. Especially the question how fast amyloid plaques grow to their final size after they are born remains controversial. By long-term two-photon in vivo imaging we monitored individual methoxy-X04-stained amyloid plaques over 6 weeks in 12 and 18 months old Tg2576 mice. We found that in 12 months old mice, newly appearing amyloid plaques were initially small in volume and subsequently grew over time. The growth rate of plaques was inversely proportional to their volume; thus amyloid plaques that were already present at the first imaging time point grew over time but slower compared to new plaques. Additionally, we analyzed 18 months old Tg2576 mice in which we neither found newly appearing plaques nor a significant growth of pre-existing plaques over 6 weeks of imaging. In conclusion, newly appearing amyloid plaques are initially small in size but grow over time until plaque growth can not be detected anymore in aged mice. These results suggest that drugs that target plaque formation should be most effective early in the disease, when plaques are growing. © The Author(s) 2010.},

However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are unknown. By employing in vivo two-photon Ca 2+ imaging of layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mice expressing human Aβ and tau, we reveal a dramatic tau-dependent suppression of activity and silencing of many neurons, which dominates over Aβ-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. We show that neurofibrillary tangles are neither sufficient nor required for the silencing, which instead is dependent on soluble tau. Surprisingly, although rapidly effective in tau mice, suppression of tau gene expression was much less effective in rescuing neuronal impairments in mice containing both Aβ and tau. Together, our results reveal how Aβ and tau synergize to impair the functional integrity of neural circuits in vivo and suggest a possible cellular explanation contributing to disappointing results from anti-Aβ therapeutic trials.},

Anecdotes abound of researchers listening to spikes in real time and noticing patterns of activity related to ongoing stimuli or behaviors. With the advent of large-scale recordings, such close observation of data has become difficult. To find patterns in large-scale neural data, we developed ‘Rastermap’, a visualization method that displays neurons as a raster plot after sorting them along a one-dimensional axis based on their activity patterns. We benchmarked Rastermap on realistic simulations and then used it to explore recordings of tens of thousands of neurons from mouse cortex during spontaneous, stimulus-evoked and task-evoked epochs. We also applied Rastermap to whole-brain zebrafish recordings; to wide-field imaging data; to electrophysiological recordings in rat hippocampus, monkey frontal cortex and various cortical and subcortical regions in mice; and to artificial neural networks. Finally, we illustrate high-dimensional scenarios where Rastermap and similar algorithms cannot be used effectively.},

   abstract = {The incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, increases rapidly with age, but why age constitutes the main risk factor is still poorly understood. Brain ageing affects oligodendrocytes and the structural integrity of myelin sheaths1, the latter of which is associated with secondary neuroinflammation2,3. As oligodendrocytes support axonal energy metabolism and neuronal health4–7, we hypothesized that loss of myelin integrity could be an upstream risk factor for neuronal amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, the central neuropathological hallmark of AD. Here we identify genetic pathways of myelin dysfunction and demyelinating injuries as potent drivers of amyloid deposition in mouse models of AD. Mechanistically, myelin dysfunction causes the accumulation of the Aβ-producing machinery within axonal swellings and increases the cleavage of cortical amyloid precursor protein. Suprisingly, AD mice with dysfunctional myelin lack plaque-corralling microglia despite an overall increase in their numbers. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics of AD mouse models with myelin defects show that there is a concomitant induction of highly similar but distinct disease-associated microglia signatures specific to myelin damage and amyloid plaques, respectively. Despite successful induction, amyloid disease-associated microglia (DAM) that usually clear amyloid plaques are apparently distracted to nearby myelin damage. Our data suggest a working model whereby age-dependent structural defects of myelin promote Aβ plaque formation directly and indirectly and are therefore an upstream AD risk factor. Improving oligodendrocyte health and myelin integrity could be a promising target to delay development and slow progression of AD.},
